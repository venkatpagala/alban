# Definition #

This is what I call open source :
Code under this project can be use by any one, as soon as you contribute to the project ;-) (You can use it any way, but it would be nice to share you improvement and knowledge).

# Warning #

I have not checked that every dependencies are open source. But it should be, as I did this project myself or found everything on the net.

# Your right #

If any code or dependency is not "free", delete it!!! (Or ask me to do so)
